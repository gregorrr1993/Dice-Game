# Dice-Game

Simulates six-sided die roll for two players. Higher number wins.

Created during Udemy course The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp. Project called as first boss challenge. In first video was shown how complete site should work. Images, html and css was provided. Then challenge was to apply gained knowledge to write JavaScript code to make website up and running. Originally it was intended to work by refreshing site, but it wasn't satisfying, so I added a Play button :)
