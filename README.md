# Dice-Game
Created during Udemy course The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp. Project called as first boss challenge. At the begging was shown finished site. As usual images, html and css was provided. Then challenge was to apply gained knowledge to write JavaScript code to make website up and running. Originally it was intended to work by refreshing site, but it wasn't satisfying, so I added a Play button :)
